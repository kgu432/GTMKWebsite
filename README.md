# GTMKWebsite
Created a website for a mechanical keyboards club I founded at Georgia Tech. Everything was coded using HTML and CSS.

### Home Page
I designed the home page to look like something similar to the Google search page, and clicking on my profile picture (Phil from Promised Neverland in the top left corner) redirects to the actual website.

### About Us
The about us page has a little blurb about the GT Mechanical Keyboards club and what we do. Underneath it is a carousel of some of the keyboards our members have built.
